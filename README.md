## Development

All scripts are managed by Rojo (6.2.0). Follow the instructions on [the website](https://rojo.space/) if you wish to use it.

Copies of each script are already present in the .rbxl.
If you simply wish to edit them in Roblox, you should not need to set up Rojo.
It is important in this case to isolate the .rbxl and never use Rojo with the project, otherwise modified scripts may be overriden.
